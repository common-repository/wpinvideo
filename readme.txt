== Description ==

As I started to get into posting videos, I found out that Adbrite provided text ads in videos with their invideo plugin. I built this plugin to make it simple to add Adbrite Invideo videos to your wordpress blog posts.

== Installation ==

1. Download, unzip and upload to your WordPress plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin within you WordPress Administration Backend
3. Grab your invideo code and look for (abWritePlayer(XXXXXX, YYY, ZZZ,), from Adbrite and in your post type in: [wpinvideo Video_ID,Video_Width,Video_Height], where Video_ID is the XXXXX, Width is YYY and Height is ZZZ
